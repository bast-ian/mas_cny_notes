# mas_cny_notes

The Monetary Authority of Singapore prints new $2 notes to supplement increased demand for gifting angbaos (red-packets) during Lunar New Year every year. Most of these notes have to be returned to MAS because they exceed normal circulation and trend growth in money demand after the festival. If the amount returned exceed storage capacity, the notes are used to replace old notes in circulation and storage alongside being saved for next LNY. While the notes replaced and incinerated are older ones, some may not have been needed to be replaced with new notes at that particular time. These amount to excess costs incurred by MAS to allow Singaporeans to celebrate CNY with new $2 notes annually. The Excel model and dashboard aims to help MAS forecast money demand for $2 notes during the Lunar New Year and calculate and minimize these excess costs. Instructions for using the model are available within the Excel file.
